# steps to read Prims_Dijkstra
* open Dijkstra
  1. edge.txt is the dataset file of weights between source and destination city.
  2. city.txt is name of cities serial number wise.
  3. open src
  4. module-info.java is class file to implement GUI & JFileComposser.
  5. open Dijkstra folder.
  6. DijkstraSP is the main class file to implement Dijkstra algorithm and find shortest path.
  8. MatrixToEdge.java converts matrix (matrix.txt) to list form(edge.txt).
  9. all other java classes are dependencies required to run Dijkstra.java.
      
*open Prims
 1. Ndata.txt is dataset of lattitute ,longitute and population with city name.
 2. open src.
 3. module-info.java is used to implement GUI & JFileComposser.
 4. open prims.
 5. Prims.java is the main java class to find shortest path.
